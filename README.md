# supervised-learning
A brief practical comparison between several supervised algorithms used in machine learning.

I submitted this project as part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.

Through this notebook you fill find information on:
* data exploration
* data pre-processing
* model suitability
* creation of training and predicting pipelines
* model evaluation
* model tuning
* feature importance
