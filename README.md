# supervised-learning
A brief practical comparison between several supervised algorithms used in machine learning.

I submitted this project as part of the Udacity's Introduction Into Machine Learning Nanodegree program. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.

Through this notebook you fill find information on:
* data exploration
* data pre-processing
* model suitability
* creation of training and predicting pipelines
* model evaluation
* model tuning
* feature importance


## Project Highlights
This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things that can be learned from this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
